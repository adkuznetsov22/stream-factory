00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.000
who will be saved this mystery seems harder

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.840
than it seems

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:06.961
give you a few seconds to study the details in both pictures

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.040
write your answer

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.040
male or female in the comments below

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.320
and I will reveal the correct answer at the very end

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.880
next mini task

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.440
you can find fallen bricks in 1 of the rooms

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.480
if you got it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.320
double tap the screen right now

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480
to confirm your genius ok

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.480
task number 3

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.920
hold down the comment button and pick an emoji

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.440
which best describes your mood

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.720
I bet you have now chosen an emoji with a thoughtful face

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.480
if I'm right let me know

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.520
by the way did you know

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:41.761
what if you follow me

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.520
my avatar will start dancing

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.800
let's try let's go

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840
task number 4

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.640
what app appears 1st

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.560
when you click share and then more

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.200
I will assume that this is either a message app

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880
either watsap if I'm right

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.000
you drop out and can't continue

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280
and now time for the final test

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.080
I warn it is difficult

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.360
only 10% will handle him in less than 3 seconds

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.080
what numbers do you see hidden in this picture

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.560
and now the long-awaited answer to our very first question

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.600
correct answer

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.720
woman will be saved

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.400
if you look closely at her door

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.160
bright light breaks through the cracks

00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:24.761
around the perimeter of the frame and under the door

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.440
indicating that it is either not locked

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.040
either not airtight and opens the way out

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.560
unlike a mans door

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.000
which seems impenetrable

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.360
you guessed let me know in the comments
